Instant “GIF Evidence” Recorder – deep-dive spec

Goal

A tester sees a bug → double-clicks tray icon (or hits a global hot-key) → the last 10 to 30 seconds of screen activity are already in RAM → instantly saved as a sub-1 MB looping GIF → 
file is dropped in a folder and Markdown link is copied to clipboard so the tester can paste straight into Jira/Notion/Slack.

No window ever opens unless the user wants to change settings.
